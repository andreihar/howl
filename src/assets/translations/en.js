He played in it for almost 3 years, but due to the lack of experience of some players in the team, the team fell apart and the 17-year-old Vova went inactive for a short time.</p><p>In 2010, fate brought him together with Andrei Harbachov during one of the Belarusian tournaments, where Bomb1la played as the coordinator of the Belarusian mix. The newly created team was based precisely on Uładzimier, who thought it necessary to invite Andrei as well, because there was no choice among Minsk players as such, and young and promising players were always good. After that, they played in the team <0></0> <strong>Frunzaŭščyna</strong> for a year and a half. Local tournaments began to be charged with global ones, which served the disintegration of the team.</p><p>In 2012, as a result of the release of a new version of CS, he went inactive, because he never managed to get used to the new physics and graphics. He began to develop e-sports in his homeland, but as a result of the country\'s broken economy, he failed.Then he began to train various teams, trying to regain his legendary name.</p><p>Around the same time, Uładzimier joined the eSports Federation of Belarus, being one of the many representatives of the eSports discipline CS:GO, however, he coached teams does not give up, but on the contrary - combines work and hobbies.</p><p>Acquaintance and friendship with Andrei enabled Uładzimier to get a trainer slot at <3></3> <strong>HOWL Gaming</strong>.</p>'

				story: "<p>The story of the formation of the future CS'er began back in 2002, when Andrei, being a 5-year-old child, found a teenager playing one of the versions of the original Counter-Strike. Despite the fact that this meeting will soon be forgotten by Andrei, it still left its mark.</p><p>In 2006, Andrei met CS 1.6 again and, being interested in it, bought it and started playing against bots. However, Bulhkin was able to test his \"high\" skills in 5th grade - after 2 years, it was decided to organise a competitive match in the class, for which he signed up. The Internet was already in full swing, so downloading a file of 100 and a half megabytes was not a special task. However, the ambitions of young players were not limited, so it was difficult to call it such a team, because there were no roles, tactics were not considered an important aspect of the game at all, and the game was usually always played on the same map. However, the guys didn't set any special goals either - they just played 2 on 2 and had fun.</p><p>In a short time in 2010, Andrei managed to get to the Belarusian LAN tournament as part of a mix called <0></0> <strong>team 177</strong>. On it, he managed to meet Uładzimier Babok - one of the best players and leaders in the place at that time. He asked Bulhkin to join the new team <0></0> <strong>Frunzaŭščyna</strong>, which was based on Bomb1la. However, due to the decrease in the number of local tournaments and the decline of CS in Belarus, the team lasted only a year and a half. After that, the tournaments were over.</p><p>At the end of 2014, Bulkin decided to try a newer version of CS:S. Considering its mechanics and the small difference with the previous version, Andrei decides not to switch to it completely. However, many friends have long encouraged Andrei to purchase the latest version of CS. Having overcome the new economic crisis in Belarus, Bulhkin earns an unfortunate 120,000 roubles and in early 2015 purchases CS:GO. The transition turned out to be more difficult than it seemed - mechanics, graphics, physics - all these aspects were radically different from CS 1.6. The only thing that is easy for Andrei is grenades, the physics of which turned out to be much easier to master than the physics of their counterparts in CS 1.6. In the same year, Bulhkin plays his last tournament match as the captain of the mix and after that decides to leave his semi-professional career, because he was still not good at CS:GO. enter the semi-professional scene. Thus, in May 2015, the team <0></0> <strong>Free Horde</strong> was formed, which was based on Bulhkin's friends from Belarus and Russia. Despite all the desire, the team will not be able to make it to the top because of the poor organisation of its players. Numerous attempts to revive it did not bring success. Having decided that it would be easier to join an already established team, in the summer of 2017 Andrei joins the Russian organisation <2></2> <strong>RHB</strong>, and on August 7, the CS:GO clan decides to separate and creates its new team - <3></3> <strong>HOWL</strong>, where Bulhkin will continue to play.</p>"

Unfortunately, until then he did not have the Internet and had to play pirated games bought in a local store, but passed a couple of months and his parents decided to join the Internet, and immediately after that, Naran found the game CS 1.6, which was both difficult and incomprehensible, and even later, the very concept of eSports his free time. School, CS, help around the house (when needed) and again. That's how time went by, and OIITiMiCT's skill (Naran's old nickname) grew. Naran switched to it and liked it more because of its casualness reminiscent of Call of Duty, the game he discovered the concept of shooters with. Haven't been able to play as well as before because Sourse has left its little bad fruit. But that didn't stop ReD CooL (Naran's second nickname) and he started learning how to play Counter-Strike in a new way. Sometimes Naran took a break in the form of good old Dota (all stars now), which made him a good player in MOBA-type games.</p><p>After the release of CS:GO, DeeZiK did not immediately switch, because he felt that VALVE will make CS for casuals again like with Source. But about 4-5 months after that, during his birthday, his cousin gives him a disc with this game, saying only one phrase that will put him in a good mood for a long time: \"break their booths\". Then DeeZiK cautiously launched CS:GO and decided to play a couple of games, and immediately noticed that the physics, grenade models and the whole game were different from CS 1.6, but these differences were not particularly big, which made sense for Naran to switch from the old one. unfortunately dying CS 1.6, to a newer version.</p><p>In 2016, Naran creates a CS:GO team from Russian players, which will later be called <2></2> <strong>RHB</strong> and will become a clan with Dota 2, Arma 3 and other games.
